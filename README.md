# Diabetes-Checkup


## Objective
In this project, we aim to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various characteristics such as glucose level, insulin, age, BMI.. . During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one. Next, we create a website application using Flask.
